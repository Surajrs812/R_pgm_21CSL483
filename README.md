# R Programs

1. [Fibonacci Sequence](pgm_01.R)
   - Original Question:
     ```
     Write an R program to print the Fibonacci sequence.
     ```
   
2. [Quadratic Equation Roots](pgm_02.R)
   - Original Question:
     ```
     Write a R Program to find the roots of a quadratic equation by considering all types of roots.
     ```

3. [Minimum of a Vector](pgm_03.R)
   - Original Question:
     ```
     Write a program in R that uses a loop to find the minimum of a vector x, without using any predefined
     functions like min(...) or sort(...). You will need to define a variable, x.min say, in which to keep the smallest
     value you have yet seen. Start by assigning x.min <- x[1] then use a for loop to compare x.min with x[2], x[3],
     etc. If/when you find x[i] < x.min, update the value of x.min accordingly.
     ```

4. [Number Guessing Game](pgm_04.R)
   - Original Question:
     ```
     Write a program in R that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and prompts the user to guess the
     number. If the user's guess is too high, the program should print "Too high!". If the user's guess is too low,
     the program should print "Too low!". If the user's guess is correct, the program should print
     "Congratulations!"
     ```

5. [Vowel and Consonant Counter](pgm_05.R)
   - Original Question:
     ```
     Write a program in R that prompts the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o,
     u) and consonants in the sentence using an if statement and a for loop.
     ```

6. [Mean and Median Calculator](pgm_06.R)
   - Original Question:
     ```
     Write a program in R that creates a data frame with two columns: a list of names and a list of corresponding
     ages. Use the apply family of functions to calculate the mean and median for the age of all the people in the
     data frame.
     ```

7. [Data Frames and Lists](pgm_07.R)
   - Original Question:
     ```
     Create a list in R that contains three data frames: the first data frame should contain information about
     students (name, age, major), the second data frame should contain information about courses (name, number,
     instructor), and the third data frame should contain information about enrolments (student, course).
     ```

8. [Replace Negative Values](pgm_08.R)
   - Original Question:
     ```
     Write a program in R that reads in a list of numbers from a file and replaces any negative values with zero
     using the apply family of functions to calculate and display the mean, variance and standard deviation of
     each column in the data frame.
     ```

9. [Function for Column Stats](pgm_09.R)
   - Original Question:
     ```
     Write a program in R that defines different or multiple functions that take a data frame as an argument and
     return the mean, median, and standard deviation respectively, of a specified column. Call the function with
     a data frame that contains at least one column with numeric values.
     ```

10. [Student Class and Functions](pgm_10.R)
    - Original Question:
      ```
      Write a program in R that defines student class with name, age, and height as attributes. Convert the names
      of the students into uppercase and use different or multiple functions that take a data frame as an argument
      and return the mean, median, and standard deviation respectively, of a specified column. Call the function
      with a data frame that contains at least one column with numeric values and display the results for mean,
      median, and SD.
      NOTE: CONSIDER AT LEAST 10 STUDENT RECORDS.
      ```
